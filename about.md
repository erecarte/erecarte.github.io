## About me
Hi, I'm Enrique Recarte. Welcome to my site!
I'm a software developer originally from [Gran Canaria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Canaria), currently working at [IG](http://www.ig.com) in London since 2010.
I like blogging about anything related to software development but mostly about Java, Spring and Agile.
I'm obsessed with code quality and design.

## About the site
This site was developed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), is hosted on [Github Pages]( https://pages.github.com) and
is based on the [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme.

I use [Prose.io](http://www.prose.io) to write the blog posts, [Photor](http://www.photor.com) to add some effects to the
photos, [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) for software diagrams and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as my main IDE.
